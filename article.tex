Say what your solution achieves, not what it is. Say what follows from
your solutions.

\begin{quote}
What is the specific problem did you (attempt to) solve?\footnote{Getting
  to the point as soon as possible is very important. I do not recommend
  putting any background before stating what the point of your paper is.
  Sentence 1 is more important than the abstract.} Why exactly does this
problem exist? Who specifically has this problem? Scientists? Military?
Industry?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{importance}{%

\begin{quote}
Briefly what is your solution? Reference
fig.~\ref{fig:solution}.\footnote{Getting an impressive figure on page
  one is very important. Most people skim figures before they do
  anything else. Fig. 1 is more important than sentence 1.}

Did you create a working prototype? Did it meet your sucess criteria?
Are further improvements likely?

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

\begin{quote}
I try to avoid including this section. It lengthens and defocusses the
paper. I try to push this information into references or appendix. I
assume my readers are either experts or know how to look things up. If
you need this, keep it as short as possible or attempt to fold it into
the Introduction and/or Related Work.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Are there any conccepts required to understand the rest of your paper
that you would not already expect your readers to understand?\footnote{Look
  to reference texts books or comprehensive review papers.}

solution?

\begin{quote}
What does the system look like? What are the functional subsystems? How
do the subsytems interact?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
For each subsystem: What is it? How does it work? How does it interact?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{system-model}{%
\subsection{System Model}\label{system-model}}

\begin{quote}
I prefer to start with a broad picture and then drill down into details
rather than start with building blocks and build up into full structure.
This is an uncommon choice, but one that I believe strongly in.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What is the overall state model? What are the state variables? How are
they related?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What category of system or equation is this? (ie. harmonic oscillator)
What kinds of results does it predict?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{system-elements}{%
\subsection{System Elements}\label{system-elements}}

\begin{quote}
For each term:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What does this represent physically? How do you predict the term?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What assumptions are you making? Are they realisitic, conservative,
conditional, or stupid?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Can it be measured? Does measurement match prediction? Under what
conditions? What does this mean? Are only emperical measured values
valid?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{system-dynamics}{%

\begin{quote}
Given characterisitics of each element, how is model expected to behave?

\begin{quote}
Is the system stable?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{modeling-results}{%
\section{Modeling Results}\label{modeling-results}}

\begin{quote}
Why using models instead of models matched to lab results?\footnote{Model
  results can fold nicely into lab tests, but some projects rely heavily
  on modeling. This is fine, but it should be justified.}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Are these model results reasonable?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What assumptions are being made? Why is this valid?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{lab-results}{%
\section{Lab Results}\label{lab-results}}

\begin{quote}
What needs testing?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
For each test: How did you set up the tests? How did you isolate
variables? How did you control inputs? How did you measure outputs? Did
results match expectations? What do results mean?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Do lab results generally match expectations? Can a system be deployed
based on results?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{field-results}{%
\section{Field Results}\label{field-results}}

\begin{quote}
Who? What? When? Where? How?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Location, Depth, Duration, Distance?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What are qualitative observations? Expectations vs Reality?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What did you demonstrate?\footnote{This is a big deal and very
  impressive. While it only amounts to a paragraph or two of writing, it
  is the thing that makes a paper. Real artists ship, and real engineers
  deploy.}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What Technology Readiness Level (TRL)\footnote{I use the precise wording
  from TRL without actually refering to it. For example, TRL4
  -\textgreater{} ``validated in lab'', TRL6 -\textgreater{}
  ``demonstrated in the deep sea environment''} is the system in? What
is next for this project? What needs to be investigated further? What
needs to be tested?
